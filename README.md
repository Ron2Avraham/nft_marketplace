The repository got all of the files that needed to be execute except the gradle and Node moudles, 
so to run the repository locally you need to do this: 

Step 1. Clone the project from github repo.

Step 2. Open it in any code editor.

Step 3. Install node_modules by running npm install command in terminal.

Step 4. Open android studio and open the react-native-app/android folder inside it.


Note: Android Studio will automatically start downloading the gradle and build it, which you can see in bottom part of android studio.

Step 5: After gradle files are downloaded and build successfully, go back to the code editor and try to run your app again using
npx react-native run-android
